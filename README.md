# KeyDownload

Enter your deck id (the part of the URL that looks like this "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"), and an output file path in whatever format the images on the server are using (currently PNG).

The program will download card images and generate a single sheet image with all of the cards.

To import into TTS, upload your deck somewhere (e.g. imgur.com), then go into a private TTS table. In the Objects window, select a Custom Deck, and use your direct image URL as the deck face. You will have to find another image for the card backs (AFAIK, the real back isn't available on the Keyforge website yet). Set the width and height to 6 and count to 36. Also make sure you also select to use the back image as the hidden face, since the sheet doesn't have a separate image for that unless you add your own.
